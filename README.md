# clock-for-omnis

Clock demo

Library was created in Omnis Studio 6.0.3

This demonstrates a clock that you can use in your program. It could be modified to include multiple clocks in different timezones by passing in different offsets to current time to get different timezones. It also could be modified to be used as a subwindow in other windows.

This shows how something can be created on-the-fly from an empty window and altered as you go.

Feel free to use this in anyway you wish.
